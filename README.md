# portfolio-creator

Creates an HTML and PDF Developer Portfolio.

## Installation

First, download Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Then, make a copy of my repo locally.

Lastly, you need to run npm install in order to download the dependencies required.

```
npm install
```

NOTE: Because I have saved the dependencies to package.json and my git repo, you may not need to install anything besides node.

## Usage

Once you have my repo locally, simply navigate to the folder in your terminal.

Then, just run the program in node.

```
node index
```

You will be prompted for your github username. After that, you'll be given four colors to choose from (in terminal still).

Then, you will see confirmation that you have an HTML and PDF dev portfolio in your file system!
